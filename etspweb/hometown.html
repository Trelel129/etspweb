      <h1>Probolinggo City</h1>
      <p>
        Even though I was born in Surabaya, but my hometown is Probolinggo City, a quite small city in Jawa Timur.
        In this city i grown up from child till graduate from highschool.
        I was live with my parent in Jalan Citarum, Pondok Gabriela housing.

        Before it named "Probolinggo", this city known as "Banger".
        "Banger" was a small hamlet under the Akuwu government in Sukodono.
        The name Banger is known from the Negarakertagama book written by the famous poet of the Majapahit Kingdom, namely Prapanca.
        "Probolinggo" comes from two words, "Probo" means ray/beam, and "Linggo" means monument, body, or sign.
        "Probolinggo" means ray which has the shape of monument (maybe it meant to be a meteor).
      </p>
      <p>
        There are a lot of famous thing about this city, one of them is "Gending wind". 
        This wind blows from Bromo Mountain, bringing dry air to the city which have been passed.
        That's why Probolinggo seldom have hot temperature. 
        In which it makes the people playing kites more often.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beside the wind Probolinggo have two local fruits, mangoes and grapes. 
        Those local fruit so famous until it has it's own monument.
        That's why Probolinggo City has another name, "Bayuangga".
        It comes from "Bayu"(winds), "anggur"(grapes), and "mangga"(manggoes).
      </p>
